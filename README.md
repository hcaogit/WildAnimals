Camera Traps (or Wild Cams) enable the automatic collection of large quantities of image data. Biologists all over the world use camera traps to monitor biodiversity and population density of animal species. Scientists have recently been making strides towards automating the species classification challenge in camera traps, but as they try to expand the scope of these models from specific regions where they have collected training data to nearby areas they are faced with an interesting probem: how do you classify a species in a new region that you may not have seen in previous training data?

In order to tackle this problem, they have prepared a challenge where the training data and test data are from different regions, namely The American Southwest and the American Northwest. The species seen in each region overlap, but are not identical, and the challenge is to classify the test species correctly. To this end, we will allow training on our American Southwest data (from CaltechCameraTraps), on iNaturalist 2017/2018 data, and on simulated data generated from Microsoft AirSim. We have provided a taxonomy file mapping our classes into the iNat taxonomy.
